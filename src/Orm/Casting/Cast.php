/**
 * A value transformation between the PHP entity representation and the
 * raw store representation.
 *
 * Direction conventions (used consistently across the ORM):
 *
 *   encode()  PHP entity value   ->  raw store value (write path)
 *   decode()  raw store value    ->  PHP entity value (read path)
 *
 * The store representation is what flows through the write pipeline and
 * the heap snapshots: EntityManager::extractData() encodes before values
 * reach a Store, and node->data holds the RAW encoded value so the diff
 * engine's `!==` comparison operates on stable scalars. The PHP
 * representation is what entity properties hold after hydration.
 *
 * Implementations must be null-transparent (encode(null) === null,
 * decode(null) === null) and stateless — a single instance is shared by
 * all classes and rows of the registered type.
